## Mail Services

## Operating Systems
### Android
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Try to avoid using Google Android or any Android that has been modified and tuned by any manufacturer such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, etc. Android is an Open Source project - [AOSP - Android Open Source Project]() - and it has many versions that will respect the user privacy and data and won't share it with private servers from manufacturers or service providers.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead Use:**

## Social Networks
### Instagram
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic ui-design.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead Use:**
* [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) - Decentralized, federated and Open Source alternative to Instagram with posts, videos, stories, tags, etc.

### Youtube
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use YouTube (or at least the official client). Youtube is very privacy invasive, it generates a very accurate profile based on your interests. Also it is a [radicalization tool](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-youtubes-algorithm-lead-to-radicalization) which shows [biased content to users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) in order to get more engadgement and to get them to watch more and more content creating an [adiction](https://medium.com/dataseries/how-youtube-is-addictive-259d5c575883). It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. Youtube censors a lot. Youtube collects a LOT of your data: interesnts, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc...
